                            <strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Cosmopolitan Consumer Group in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Cosmopolitan Consumer Group agree to resolve disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction (“Agreement to Arbitrate”). Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You acknowledge and agree that the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that individual party’s claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect other users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND Cosmopolitan Consumer Group ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                a) Claims To Be Resolved By Binding Arbitration. You and Cosmopolitan Consumer Group agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Terms; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section (A) {above}, you and Cosmopolitan Consumer Group agree that no statement herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either party’s right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in any competent court of law; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                c) Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Cosmopolitan Consumer Group will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Cosmopolitan Consumer Group.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                d) Notice and Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Cosmopolitan Consumer Group should be addressed to: Cosmopolitan Consumer Group, Inc., 8 The Green Suit A, Dover, Delaware 19901 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If you and Cosmopolitan Consumer Group do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Cosmopolitan Consumer Group may commence an arbitration proceeding.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                e) Fees. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Cosmopolitan Consumer Group will, at your request, reimburse you for your payment of the arbitration filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any request for payment of fees by Cosmopolitan Consumer Group should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and Cosmopolitan Consumer Group will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), you agree to reimburse Cosmopolitan Consumer Group for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Cosmopolitan Consumer Group on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA’s rules.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. Any in-person arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Los Angeles, CA. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                f) No Class Actions. Unless both you and Cosmopolitan Consumer Group agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            YOU AND Cosmopolitan Consumer Group AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                g) Opt-Out. If you are a new Cosmopolitan Consumer Group user, you can choose to reject the arbitration agreement contained in this Section (“opt-out”) by mailing us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”). The Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than thirty (30) days after the date you accept these Terms for the first time. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to the Notice Address above.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            The Opt-Out Notice must contain your name, address (including street address, city, state and zip code), and the user name(s) and email address(es) associated with the Cosmopolitan Consumer Group account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with Cosmopolitan Consumer Group.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                h) Modifications. If Cosmopolitan Consumer Group makes any future change to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. You acknowledge and agree that, in the event you reject any future change, your account with Cosmopolitan Consumer Group shall be immediately terminated and you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                i) Severability and Enforceability. If an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Section is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Section shall still apply. If the entirety of this Section is found to be unenforceable, then the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described herein shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms, and that the remainder of the Terms will continue to apply.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            <strong>WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY OF TERMS</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At any time, should Cosmopolitan Consumer Group fail to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS, such failure shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect.
